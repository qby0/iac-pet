This is my simple AWS learning project using Terraform. I'm exploring basic AWS services with hands-on practice.

# Day 1

- Set up a basic Terraform project for AWS.
- Added a VPC module with two public subnets in eu-central-1.
- Created and set variables along with version requirements.
- Configured default tags and the AWS region.
- Added a .gitignore to exclude state and provider files.
- Ran `terraform init` and `terraform plan` successfully.
